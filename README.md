# Food Waste Management
One of the biggest problems and most ignored issues in today's world is food waste. In the world, one third of the food that is produced is wasted. Despite being completely edible, several restaurants and cafes have a policy of not serving meals from the day before. At the end of the day, everything is considered "waste."

Our application provides a way to bridge the gap between the wastage and deficit, by letting restaurants donate this food to NGOs, who in turn can feed the needy.
- We have created a system to manage the flow of food waste by redistributing it from restaurants to those in need.
- To do this, we have several groups, including restaurants, NGOs, and logistics, who are all working together to achieve this goal.
- Restaurants submit requests for the collection of food, which are distributed to all NGOs in the network. These requests must, however, include food that won't spoil right away (it must be edible in at least four hours). Based on the viability of the request, any NGO can pick up the request and assign it to any logistics partner in the network.
- These logistics companies then pick up the requested item from the restaurant and deliver it to the requested NGO.
- NGOs can also request that other NGOs in the network direct restaurant requests to the specific NGO that is experiencing inventory shortages.
- Logistics charges the requesting NGO for the deliveries, sending them invoices that are then paid for by the NGO. A mayor can view all the activities.
